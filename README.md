Old experiment of creating a language for calculating proofs of theorems, based
on logic, S-expression interpretation, proof rules, and binding compound
expressions to values.  Inspired by Eric Hehner's book [A Practical Theory of
Programming](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hehner/aPToP/).

The test program that exercises it can be run like:
```
cd ..
scheme-script logji/tests/calc.sps
```
